# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

By default, only the current most recent version is supported at all, both for security purposes and otherwise. This is due to limited resources and a lack of funding. If you want this to be different, please provide funding.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact [Tom Parker-Shemilt](mailto:palfrey@tevp.net) to report a vulnerability. Best efforts will be made to respond rapidly to legitimate security issues, but no promises are made, again because of a lack of funding.
